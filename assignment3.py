# Even or Odd Checker Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd using an if-else stat# Find the Largest Number Create a Python program that takes three numbers as input and uses if-else conditions to find and display the largest number.

# Sum of Numbers in a Range Write a Python program that takes two numbers (start and end) as input and uses a for loop to compute and display the sum of all numbers in that range.

# FizzBuzz Game Write a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 50. However:

# For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

# For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".

# For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
