# Tuple Creation

my_tuple = (1, 2, "Lucky", "Prasad", 76.5)

# Print the tuple.
print(my_tuple)
# Accessing Elements
print(*my_tuple)
for i in my_tuple:
    print(i)
# Print the first and last element of my_tuple using indexing.
print(my_tuple[0])
print(my_tuple[-1])
# Use negative indexing to access the second last element.
print(my_tuple[-2])
# Tuple Slicing
print(my_tuple[2:4])
# Slice and print the first three elements of my_tuple.
print(my_tuple[:3])
# Slice and print the last two elements.
print(my_tuple[: -3: -1])
# Tuple Operations

# Tuple Methods

# Find the index of a specific element in my_tuple and print it.

# Tuple Immutability

"""The error is 
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Explain why tuples are immutable.
"""_summary_
Tuples are immutable meaning they cannot be changed.Precisely speaking, we cannot change their values, their size.
We cannot append, insert, remove, pop, and some other mutable methods. The only thing we can perform on tuples is  index and count
which can only retrive information but won't change anything.

# Tuple Packing and Unpacking
packing_tuple = 1, 2, 3
print(packing_tuple)
# Create a tuple with three elements and unpack them into individual variables.

# Tuple Iteration

# Use a loop to iterate through my_tuple and print each element.

# Write a function that returns multiple values using a tuple.
